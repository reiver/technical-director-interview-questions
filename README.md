# Technical Director (TD) Interview Questions
by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

This document provides interview questions for a **technical director**.

I.e., if you are trying to hire a **technical director**, then you could include these questions as part of your interview.

## What Is A Technical Director (TD)

What is a **technical director**‽

The unsatisfying answer is:
> A **technical director** (**TD**) is whomever a company gives the title of **technical director** (**TD**) to.

That's actually the accurate answer to that question.

BUT — that is not an answer many (probably most) people want to hear. So I'll answer a different but more useful question:
> What do I expect from someone I give the title of **technical director** (**TD**) to‽
 
Here is the answer to that question — what I expect from someone when I give them the title of **technical director** (**TD**):
> In a company with cross-functional teams, the **technical director** (**TD**) provides supervision, management, leadership, and techical direction to (at least) the software developers, and maybe also to other people on the team.

## Management Jargon

Let's get into a bit of management jargon —

(There is a reason I'm covering this, so bear with me.)

I always hated this language but — HR types often divide up people in a company into:

* resources, and
* overhead.

_Resources_ do the actual "real" work, _overhead_ don't.

**Supervisors** are _overhead._
**Administrators** are _overhead_.
**Managers** are _overhead._
**Leaders** are _overhead_.
**Directors** are _overhead_.

Having said that — this is a good segue into the difference between **supervision**, **administration**, **management**, **leadership**, and **direction**.

* **supervisors** — primarily concerned with compliance — ex: show up on time, do what you are told, don't slack off, do your job, obey these rules, etc.

* **administrators** — primarily concerned with process & paperwork & overhead tasks — filling out forms, reports, checklists, entering stuff into the TODO list, dealing with banking, etc.

* **managers** — primarily concerned with the team and the individuals in the team — the person actually getting people to actually do the work, helping them, teaching them, training them, coordinating them, dealing with flow & alignment, dealing with blockers, velocity, efficiency, etc; they also deal with recruiting, hiring, and firing.

* **leaders** — primarily concerned with the vision, culture, and inspiring and motivating people.

* **directors** — the person specifying what the goals, targets, objectives, and results are.


Having said that, I expect a **technical director** (**TD**) to be able to do all these activities.
